# Construction Plan Verification System

## 📚 **Project Overview**
The **Construction Plan Verification System** is an automated tool designed to streamline and simplify the process of verifying architectural construction plans against government zoning laws and building regulations. This application eliminates the need for manual inspections by providing instant compliance feedback, enhancing efficiency, accuracy, and transparency in the approval process.

## 🚀 **Key Features**
- **Automated Drawing Analysis:** Extract dimensions and room details from architectural plans in PDF or JPEG formats.
- **Compliance Verification:** Validate dimensions and specifications against predefined building and zoning regulations.
- **Instant Feedback:** Provide instant feedback on compliance status with detailed reports.
- **Scalability:** Designed to handle a variety of construction plans, from residential to commercial structures.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive UI for uploading and reviewing results.

## 🛠️ **Technology Stack**
- **Backend:** Python with Quart Framework , Nodejs
- **PDF Processing:** PDFMiner.six
- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Storage:** MongoDB 

## 📊 **How It Works**
1. **Upload Architectural Plan:** Users upload their architectural plans or submission drawing in PDF formats.
2. **Data Extraction:** The system uses PDF parsing techniques to extract room dimensions and labels.
3. **Compliance Check:** The extracted data is compared against predefined zoning and construction regulations.
4. **Feedback Report:** A detailed compliance report is generated, indicating valid and invalid dimensions.
